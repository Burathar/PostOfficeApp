# Post Office App Analysis

## Reason of Development

The non-profit organisation [COC Eindhoven](http://coceindhoven.nl/) organises an Valentinesday-styled LGBT+ refugee meeting on 17-02-2018. For this event, there was an idea to let the guest send (anonymous) notes to each other. They would all carry a number, and anyone could write a note, bring it to the 'post office' and say for who it was. The 'post-office manager' would then register the 'mail' in the system, which would in turn show all pending 'mail' on a central display.

## Scenario

Alice wants to send a note to Jamie. She notices that Jamie has number 21. She writes a note, folds it up, and writes '21' on the outside. Then, she goes to the 'post office' and hands over the note to the 'post office manager'
